Lab 6 Correction

Correction to lab manual at bottom of page 2: the function prototype for adc_read should be:

int adc_read(void);

(Or some other unsigned integer type for returning the digital result.)

Note that if you write your function to read multiple samples from the sample sequencer, you may have a different return type or instead use a call by reference parameter for returning values.
