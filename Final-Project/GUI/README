This is unfinished, but I am uploading it so you can test the code if needed.
Everything should run fine, just create an eclipse project and copy over all the
files in this directory then press the run button in eclipse. Make sure wifi is 
connected to the bot! If there is anything wrong, contact me on GroupME.
